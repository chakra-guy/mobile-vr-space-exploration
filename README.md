# space-exploration-udacity-mobile-vr

## Introduction
This is my Udacity capstone project, it's an interactive mobile VR space exploration experience where users can explore three different space related scenes. 
To begin the experience, users will find themselves in a NASA hangar where they will learn how to move around (teleport), interact with objects and move between the scenes. Each scene provides a unique perspective on space exploration, where they can re-live the historical space moments.
